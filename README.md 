# 📊 Day 16 — Sentiment Analysis using LSTM

This project explores **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to perform sentiment analysis on the **IMDB Movie Review Dataset**.  
It classifies reviews as **Positive** or **Negative**, demonstrating how deep learning models can process sequential data for text understanding.

---

## 🚀 Overview
- Preprocessed IMDB reviews into padded integer sequences  
- Built an **LSTM model** with an Embedding layer for word vectorization  
- Trained and validated using binary cross-entropy loss  
- Visualized performance via loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix plots  

---

## 🧠 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing** — Load IMDB dataset and pad sequences  
2. **Model Building** — Define embedding + LSTM + dense architecture  
3. **Training** — Fit the model with early stopping  
4. **Evaluation** — Generate classification report and confusion matrix  

---

## 📈 Results
After 4 epochs:
- Accuracy: ~86–90%  
- Model: `sentiment_lstm.h5`  
- Visuals saved as:
  - `training_history.png`
  - `confusion_matrix.png`
